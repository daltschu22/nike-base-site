                        The Nike Missile Base Map is an interactive web application that displays the locations of Nike missile sites across the United States. 
                        This project aims to preserve the historical significance of these Cold War-era defensive installations by making their locations and information easily accessible.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Nike missile system was a line of American anti-aircraft missile systems designed and deployed from the 1950s to the 1970s. 
                        Named after the Greek goddess of victory, the Nike system was developed to defend against Soviet bomber attacks during the Cold War.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The system consisted of two primary components:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Launch Area:</strong> Where the missiles were stored and launched</li>
                        <li><strong>Control Area:</strong> Where radar and computer systems for tracking targets and guiding missiles were located</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Nike system went through several iterations, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nike Ajax:</strong> The first operational anti-aircraft missile system (1954)</li>
                        <li><strong>Nike Hercules:</strong> An improved version with nuclear capability (1958)</li>
                        <li><strong>Nike Zeus:</strong> An anti-ballistic missile system (never fully deployed)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        By the 1970s, most Nike missile sites were decommissioned as they became obsolete with the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and changing military strategies.
